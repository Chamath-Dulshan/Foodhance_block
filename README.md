================= Main Objective ==================

- Assurance of the quality of food items in a secure, integrity-assured manner with the use of blockchain to store data.

============= Main Research Questions =============

- The difficulty of gathering and assessing data with regards to food quality as perception of quality can vary.
- Lack of security and integrity when storing QA data as there is a possibility of data being modified at a later date.
- Large use of resources to store data at a centralized location.
- Difficulty in assuring levels of quality are not breached as enforcement depends on human vigilance.
- Lack of traceability of goods and tracking their location which may cause concerns among buyers regarding food quality.


========== Individual Research Questions ==========

- Predictive analysis-based ordering system
	- The current stock ordering systems are operated by people.
	- Its more time consuming when doing it manually.
	- Food consumptions can be different from different time periods.
	- There can be seasonal needs of food items.  
	- To give a solution for those matters automated food ordering mechanism is needed, using the predictive analysis of the consumptions of foods.
	- The main focus of the problems include;
		- Human errors when operating.
		- Problems in securing the data integrity.
		- Efficiency of the systems.
		- Use of the predictive analysis for the stock ordering system.   

	
- Quality Assurance
	- After the realization of the importance of keeping health and fitness in the lifestyle, the importance of the quality of the food productions consumed daily by the customers, new 		  techniques and methods have been discovered and implemented in order to ensure the safety and quality of food.
	- In Sri Lanka the consumers mostly attend to supermarkets, according to Umesh Gunarathne, and it is stated that there are various factors that attract customers to supermarkets, 		  such as cleanliness and the fresh appearance.
	- Therefore, ensuring the safety and quality of consumables sold in supermarket has been an issue, as it directly leads to the health and hygiene of the consumers. 
	- So that, when storing the related data, there can happen many mistakes and losses regarding data stored in the long run. 
	- Some of such issues include data losses, security breaches, due to having a centralized system the prone to failure, and data corruption. 
	- Due to these issues, maintaining quality and assuring safety and trust towards the customers are problems the supermarkets constantly face. 
	- Therefore, introducing more secure, immutable, decentralized, data corruption prone blockchain into food quality management can change many aspects of it positively.

	
- Smart Contract Implementation
	- Traditional agreements are expensive, both financially and from the perspective of time.
	- A smart contract has none of the previous issues.
	- More importantly, a smart contract is self-enforcing and quantifiable, which provides assurance to both parties that the agreement will be honored.
	- The research gap this component addresses is the volatility of agreements with regard to quality, by using a standard such as ISO 22000, an objective set of terms can be drawn up 		  and agreed upon by both parties.

	
- Tracking and Feedback Analysis
	- Many consumers will welcome a way to verify that the produce that is being marketed as fresh, is actually fresh, this component will help assure customers that the quality  	  		  standards that are being promised are met, it also allows customers to rate the food they received to express their satisfaction with the food quality.
	- Food quality upon arrival will be predicted based on the time and route taken to deliver the food to the buyer.
	- Analysis of customer feedback can quickly become complex as a combination of factors can cause an unsatisfactory review from a customer. The current variables being considered 		  are: initial quality check, delivery route, delivery time and customer feedback.
	- Anomalous results must be identified, as such, a lot of data is required to train the model.


============== Individual Objectives ==============

- Predictive analysis-based ordering system
	- The main individual objective here is to identify the needed stocks for the given supermarket or a shop for the given time period. To do this process, the data collected from the 		  supermarkets before and the previous time periods are used with the machine learning process.
	- The sub objectives include;
		- Component needs to track the current stock of the supermarket.
		- To create an automatically generated editable order list.
		- To create the interfaces that easily usable for the staff.
		- Always test the model with known data to make sure the output is accurate.
		- To implement the access control.
		- To generate alerts based on the stock limits.
	
- Quality Assurance
	- The main individual objective of this function is to identify the gaps between the existing food QA systems and implementing the proposed system to fill the gaps, to make an 		  improved food QA system using blockchain.
	- The sub objectives include;
		- To implement a corruption resistant quality assurance management mechanism for food items.
		- To ensure the safety of the consumables.
		- To ensure data immutability.
		- To avoid accidental deletion of data.
		- To provide an easy access mechanism to historical data.
	
- Smart Contract Implementation
	- The main individual object of this component is to maintain the buyer and supplier relationship by implementing digitally signed agreements which contains the details of two 	  	  parties and the terms and conditions that should be enforced to both the buyer and supplier. The benefit of implementing smart contracts is that it provides additional access upon 	  multi signature endorsement between buyer and supplier. Another benefit is that this can be used to track the guidelines of the agreement through a network device which is 	  		  implemented in the end points of the blockchain system.
	- The sub objectives include;
		- To implement a system to handle contracts between seller and buyer protecting the integrity of information.
		- To introduce smart contract handling to share information and prepare agreements between supplier and buyer.
		- To implement a mechanism to sign electronic agreements by digital signatures.
		- To track the guidelines of the agreement from a network device implemented in the endpoints of the blockchain system.
		- To ensure agreements between supplier and buyer are enforced effectively and changes can be made through the end devices of each party.
		
- Tracking and Feedback Analysis
	- The main objectives of this function are to track goods in real-time and assign a quality value to food being transported ranging from red to green, worst to best respectively, 		  and then collect and analyze feedback from customers about the quality of the food to determine whether a batch was bad or an assessment made about the quality of the food was 		  incorrect.
	- The sub objectives include;
		- To implement a real-time tracking system.
		- To ensure that tracking data is stored securely.
		- To develop and implement a quality prediction algorithm that considers the route and time taken to deliver the food.
		- To collect and analyze data from customers to observe any anomalies which includes, but is not limited to; customer feedback not reflecting the quality value assigned to 		  	  the food previously.
